# suicide-rate-eda

In this project, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of suicide rates spanning from 1985 to 2016. The objective was to gain insights into the factors affecting suicide rates, with a focus on the following key aspects: country, age group, and generation. I utilized Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to explore the dataset, uncover trends, and draw meaningful conclusions.
